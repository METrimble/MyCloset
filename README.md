# README for MyCloset
### MyCloset is a simple web app aimed to help me pick out outfits and make smart clothing purchases. All assets are custom drawn. 

## Try It Now: https://my-closet.azurewebsites.net/
Note: the lowest tier version of Azure SQL Database is used so the database may take a second to resume. You may need to refresh the website multiple times before it loads. This is currently being patched

## Future Features
This project is still currently a work in progress. Future features will include...
- More clothing options
- Multiple user sessions
- Better loading of clothing on doll
- Patch to database resume bug
